# Operation Steel Rose
This is a vehicle-centric game mode for Arma 3.

It's key objective is to create quick and dynamic firefights for players to engage in using tanks, apc, mraps and any other fighting vehicles at their disposal.


This is largely a proof of concept right now. But if it proves successful I hope to expand on this.
Think Warthunder but more fast paced, with better crew progression and running on the Arma 3 Engine.


I understand that Arma is a more infantry-centred game, as such I will make a fork which removes most of the ground vehicle bits and focuses more on infantry.
