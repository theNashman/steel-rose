# Operation Steel Rose
This is a vehicle-centric game mode for Arma 3.

It's key objective is to create quick and dynamic firefights for players to engage in using tanks, apc, mraps and any other fighting vehicles at their disposal.
Think Warthunder but more fast paced, with better crew progression and running on the Arma 3 Engine.

This is largely a proof of concept right now. But if it proves successful I hope to expand on this.
